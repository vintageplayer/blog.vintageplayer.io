Hi! I'm Aditya. After working for 3 years designing and developing Data Platforms, I took a shot at entrepreneurship.

I like to think it was in my genes, evident by my [(not-so) get-rich-quick schemes](/blog/side-hustling-since-8-years/) before I started coding professionally.

I'm the co-founder at [JiffyLabs](https://jiffyscan.xyz/), working on niche-data API infra in the blockchain world. After it's launch in Apr'23, it grew 28% MoM in usage till September'23. During which period, our fully-bootstrapped company also generated $200k as revenue. We remain a 2-man team as of September'23.

My first startup failed, the second one I think of as a mini-sucess. Both taught a lot. I'm still 26, and definitely got a couple more decades of being a founder in me.

Hope you checkout my experiences from the journey.
